# Kagenti Extensions

Kubernetes security extensions for the [Kagenti](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti) ecosystem, providing **zero-trust authentication** for workloads through transparent token exchange and dynamic Keycloak client registration using SPIFFE/SPIRE identities.

## AuthBridge

[AuthBridge](./authbridge/) provides end-to-end authentication for Kubernetes workloads with [SPIFFE/SPIRE](https://spiffe.io) integration. It consists of:

- **[AuthProxy](./authbridge/authproxy/)** — Envoy proxy with a gRPC external processor for inbound JWT validation and outbound OAuth 2.0 token exchange (RFC 8693). Enables secure service-to-service communication by transparently intercepting traffic.
- **[Client Registration](./authbridge/client-registration/)** — Automatically registers Kubernetes workloads as Keycloak OAuth2 clients using their SPIFFE identity, eliminating manual client configuration and static credentials.
- **[Keycloak Sync](./authbridge/keycloak_sync.py)** — Declarative tool for synchronizing Keycloak configuration.

See the [AuthBridge README](./authbridge/README.md) for architecture details and the [demos index](./authbridge/demos/README.md) for getting started.

## Container Images

All images are published to `ghcr.io/kagenti/kagenti-extensions/`. After
kagenti-extensions#411 the unified binary was split into three
mode-specific combined images, and the per-component sidecars
(`client-registration`, standalone `spiffe-helper`) were retired:

| Image | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `authbridge` | proxy-sidecar combined (default): authbridge-proxy + bundled spiffe-helper, full plugin set |
| `authbridge-envoy` | envoy-sidecar combined: Envoy + ext_proc + bundled spiffe-helper, full plugin set |
| `authbridge-lite` | proxy-sidecar shape, auth-only plugins (no parsers) for size-constrained deployments |
| `proxy-init` | Alpine + iptables init container (envoy-sidecar mode only) |

`spiffe-helper` is bundled inside each combined image and gated per
workload by the `SPIRE_ENABLED` env var. Client registration is
handled by the kagenti-operator's `ClientRegistrationReconciler` and
no longer ships as a separate image. The legacy `authbridge-unified`,
`authbridge-light`, `client-registration`, and standalone `spiffe-helper`
images are no longer published; older release tags continue to
publish the previous shape.

## Development

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit

# Run formatters
make fmt

# Build AuthProxy Docker images
make build-images

# Run local testing (requires Kind cluster)
./local-build-and-test.sh
```

See [LOCAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md](./LOCAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md) for the full local development setup.
