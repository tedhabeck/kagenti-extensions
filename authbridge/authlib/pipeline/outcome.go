// a small 3-value vocabulary distinct from the 5-value InvocationAction:
// Outcome describes the request as a whole (for OnFinish accounting),
// while InvocationAction describes what one plugin did in one phase.
//
// A rate-limiter refunding a slot cares about "was this call
// successful" (OutcomeAllow) vs "did a plugin choose to deny"
// (OutcomeDeny) vs "did the upstream / framework fail" (OutcomeError)
// — three distinct accounting buckets. The 5-value InvocationAction
// (allow / deny / skip / modify / observe) doesn't answer that
// question because skip / modify / observe are mid-pipeline, not
// terminal states.

// Read via pctx.Outcome(). The getter returns nil during OnRequest and
// OnResponse — plugins that accidentally inspect Outcome in those
// phases observe a nil pointer rather than a stale zero value, so the
// "this field is only meaningful in OnFinish" contract is enforced at
// read time rather than documented and forgotten.
//
// Outcome is deliberately a small struct. If a future need demands
// more context (upstream response headers, body sha256, external
// request ID, etc.) add a field here rather than inventing a parallel
// mechanism — plugins already reach for pctx.Outcome().

// OutcomeFromContext derives a best-effort Outcome from a pctx's final

// without threading outcome state through nested response / error
// callbacks. The derivation rules:
//
//   - A deny Invocation on either phase → OutcomeDeny, DenyingPlugin =
//     the most recent deny's Plugin name. Most-recent rather than
//     first so a response-side deny (e.g. an output filter) is
//     correctly attributed over any earlier record.
//   - No deny Invocation AND StatusCode > 0 → OutcomeAllow. The HTTP
//     status itself is not sufficient to classify error vs allow — a
//     legitimate 500 from the upstream is still a pipeline Allow.
//   - No deny Invocation AND StatusCode == 0 → OutcomeError (no
//     response was written: upstream transport failure, listener
//     panic, etc.).
//
// Listeners with more precise information at hand (a typed error from
// the upstream transport, a listener-level reject distinct from any
// plugin deny) should construct Outcome explicitly rather than call
// this helper. StatusCode is taken from pctx.StatusCode verbatim.
// Duration is left zero; RunFinish auto-fills from pctx.StartedAt
