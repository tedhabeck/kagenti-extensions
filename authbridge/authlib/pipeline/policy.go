package pipeline

// ErrorPolicy controls how the pipeline reacts when a plugin returns a
// Reject action (i.e., decides to deny a request or response). The
// policy wraps the plugin — plugin authors do not consume it.
//
// Default is ErrorPolicyEnforce: Reject becomes an HTTP error response
// and pipeline execution stops. Operators roll out a new guardrail in
// ErrorPolicyObserve first: the plugin still evaluates and may still
// return Reject, but the framework converts the Reject into a
// pass-through and records the would-have-denied Invocation as
// Shadow=true. ErrorPolicyOff is a kill-switch — the plugin is
// not dispatched at all.
//
// Shadowing or disabling auth gates (jwt-validation, token-exchange)
// is an authentication bypass dressed as a feature — operators SHOULD
// leave those plugins on ErrorPolicyEnforce (the default).
//
// The framework does NOT enforce this at startup: nothing prevents
// on_error: observe on jwt-validation today. A built-in-registry
// sealing pass is planned as a follow-up to reject a non-enforce
// policy on reserved gates at build time.
