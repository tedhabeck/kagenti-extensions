# AuthBridge Demos

This directory contains demo scenarios showing AuthBridge providing zero-trust
authentication for Kubernetes agent workloads. Each demo progressively introduces
more AuthBridge capabilities.

> **Note:** These demos use the operator-injected combined sidecar (after
> kagenti-extensions#411 — one image per mode: `authbridge` for proxy-sidecar,
> `authbridge-envoy` for envoy-sidecar, `authbridge-lite` for the auth-only
> shape). The previous `authbridge-unified` image and the per-component
> sidecars (`client-registration`, standalone `spiffe-helper`) have been
> removed.

## Available Demos

| Demo | Difficulty | What It Shows | Deployment |
|------|:----------:|---------------|:----------:|
| **[Weather Agent](weather-agent/demo-ui.md)** | Beginner | Inbound JWT validation, automatic identity registration, outbound passthrough | UI |
| **[Weather Agent (advanced)](weather-agent/demo-ui-advanced.md)** | Intermediate | Inbound on agent **and** tool, outbound token exchange, ingress JWT verification on the tool | [kubectl + script](weather-agent/demo-ui-advanced.md#automated-deploy-and-verify-ci-oriented) |
| **[GitHub Issue Agent](github-issue/demo.md)** | Intermediate | Inbound validation + outbound token exchange + scope-based access control | [UI](github-issue/demo-ui.md) or [Manual](github-issue/demo-manual.md) |
| **[Token-Exchange Routes](token-exchange-routes/README.md)** | Reference | How to write `authproxy-routes` for single- and multi-target token exchange | Configuration only |
| **[MCP Parser Plugin](mcp-parser/README.md)** | Reference | Enable the `mcp-parser` plugin to surface tool calls / resource reads in session events | Configuration only |
| **[abctl Walkthrough](weather-agent/demo-with-abctl.md)** | Reference | Watch the AuthBridge plugin pipeline live with the `abctl` TUI | Tooling only |
| **[IBAC](ibac/README.md)** | Intermediate | Intent-Based Access Control: LLM judge denies outbound HTTP that doesn't align with the user's recorded intent. Reproduces the email-poison / prompt-injection attack from `huang195/ibac`; chat with the agent through the kagenti UI and see the exfiltration blocked, then `make show-result` for a pipeline-level forensic | UI + kubectl |
| **[SPARC (finance)](finance-sparc/README.md)** | Intermediate | SPARC pre-tool reflection: the `sparc` plugin blocks a hallucinated/ungrounded tool argument (an invented transaction id) before it executes and transparently asks the user to clarify, then approves the corrected call. Complements IBAC — SPARC verifies argument grounding, IBAC verifies intent alignment | UI + kubectl |

## Recommended Path

**New to AuthBridge?** Start with the demos in this order:

1. **[Weather Agent](weather-agent/demo-ui.md)** — Fastest way to see AuthBridge
   in action. Deploys via the Kagenti UI with inbound JWT validation protecting
   the agent. No token exchange configuration needed; outbound traffic uses the
   default passthrough policy.

2. **[GitHub Issue Agent](github-issue/demo.md)** — Full AuthBridge demo with
   inbound validation *and* outbound token exchange. Shows how AuthBridge
   transparently exchanges tokens when the agent calls the GitHub tool, with
   scope-based access control (Alice vs Bob).

3. **[Token-Exchange Routes](token-exchange-routes/README.md)** — Reference
   for the `authproxy-routes` ConfigMap. Covers both single-target (one
   route) and multi-target (one agent → multiple tools, each with its own
   audience) patterns. Configuration-only — pair with one of the deployment
   demos above for a working stack.

## What Each Demo Covers

### Weather Agent (Getting Started)
- Deploy agent + tool via **Kagenti UI**
- AuthBridge inbound JWT validation (signature, issuer, audience)
- Automatic SPIFFE identity registration with Keycloak
- Default outbound passthrough — agents work out-of-the-box with any tool or LLM
- CLI testing: public endpoints, token rejection, valid token

### Weather Agent (Advanced)
- Same images as the beginner demo, separate **`*-advanced`** Deployments so the
  getting-started flow stays untouched
- Outbound **token exchange** to the tool SPIFFE audience (`authproxy-routes`)
- AuthBridge **injected on the MCP tool** — JWT checks at Envoy before the tool process
- `deploy_and_verify_advanced.sh` for reproducible CI-style verification (Keycloak
  exchange + MCP `initialize` without requiring a working LLM)

### GitHub Issue Agent (Full AuthBridge Flow)
- Deploy agent + tool via **Kagenti UI** or **kubectl**
- Keycloak configuration for token exchange (realm, clients, scopes)
- Inbound JWT validation protecting the agent
- Outbound OAuth 2.0 token exchange (RFC 8693) — agent-scoped token exchanged
  for tool-scoped token
- Subject preservation through exchange (`sub` claim maintained)
- Scope-based access control: Alice (public repos) vs Bob (all repos)
- Comprehensive CLI testing and AuthProxy log verification

### Token-Exchange Routes (Configuration Reference)
- How AuthBridge resolves the request `Host` header to a route entry
- ConfigMap shape for `authproxy-routes` — fields, glob patterns, ordering
- Single-target example (one route)
- Multi-target example (multiple routes, one agent → multiple tools)
- Mixing exchange and passthrough; tightening to `default_policy: exchange`
- Troubleshooting: `Host` mismatches, missing scopes, audience errors

### MCP Parser Plugin (Configuration Reference)
- How to enable the `mcp-parser` outbound plugin
- Surfaces MCP tool calls / resource reads / prompt invocations in
  session events for `abctl` and the `:9094` API
- Required `allow_mode_override: true` on the outbound ext_proc filter
  in envoy-sidecar mode

### abctl Walkthrough (Tooling Reference)
- Run the `abctl` TUI against the weather-agent's session API
- See inbound JWT validation → protocol parsers → outbound exchange
  → LLM inference → response, paired live

## Prerequisites

All demos require:
- A Kubernetes cluster with the Kagenti platform installed
  ([Installation Guide](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti/blob/main/docs/install.md))
- Keycloak deployed in the `keycloak` namespace
- SPIRE deployed (for demos using SPIFFE identity)

UI-based demos additionally require:
- The Kagenti UI running at `http://kagenti-ui.localtest.me:8080`

## Common Setup: Keycloak Port-Forward

Most demos need Keycloak accessible at `http://keycloak.localtest.me:8080`.
If not already available via an ingress:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/keycloak-service -n keycloak 8080:8080
```

## Common Setup: Python Environment

Demos that configure Keycloak need a Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd authbridge

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
